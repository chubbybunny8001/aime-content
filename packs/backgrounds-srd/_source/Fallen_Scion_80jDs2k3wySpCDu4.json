Girion Lord of Dale is dead, and I have eaten his people like a wolf among sheep, and where are his sons’ sons that dare approach me?\"</p><hr /></blockquote><h3>Overview</h3><p>You are the last of a powerful bloodline, or at least that’s what your parents and those closest to them keep telling you. Your aristocratic line was highly influential, perhaps even royal, before some calamity befell them. Perhaps the lands they once ruled were overrun or a coup drove them from power. Perhaps it’s as simple as your forebears disappearing while travelling through treacherous terrain. Whatever the case, you have a powerful destiny ahead of you should you choose to seize it.</p><hr /><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>History, Traditions</p><p><strong>Optional: </strong>Lost Scion: Black Shield </p><p><strong>Feature: </strong>@UUID[Compendium.world.backgrounds-srd.Item.aYT91uI7Pi7GgfAb]{Noble Bearing}</p><hr /><h3>Noble Baring</h3><p>Your family’s wealth, power and holdings may be gone, but your title remains. In social gatherings you are still a lord amongst lords and you are treated accordingly as such. You may call upon the rights of hospitality in any noble home and your words and advice often carry great weight; you aren’t easily dismissed. You are also expected to live up to your expectations and obligations, whatever they may be, and several nobles curry favour from you in the hopes that you reward them when your power is restored.</p><hr /><h3>Suggested Characteristics</h3><p>Fallen Scions tend to be aristocratic no matter what their current situation. They often ‘hold court’ amongst their friends and they do their best to act honourably, as they understand both the noble and common worlds. This makes them great diplomats and negotiators and they are often called upon to lead armies into battle.</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.3D8Tb0BXWjYgR4HP]{Distinctive Quality}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.fVOuVA95xElxqub9]{Specialty}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.PwgGiKw05dhSVobJ]{Hope}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.vfSXpSE08EzAKPSq]{Despair}</p></li></ul><hr /><h3>Optional: Lost Scion: Black Shield</h3><p>Not all Fallen Scions wish to draw attention to themselves; some prefer to remain in the darkness. Such individuals often create alternate identities for themselves, pretending to be roving rangers or wandering merchants rather than a fallen noble.</p><p>Such characters take the Deception proficiency in place of History or Traditions (you may select which) and only reveal their true nature to local lords when safely behind closed doors.</p>",
