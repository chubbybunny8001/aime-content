This may be because it no longer exists, your people cast you out for some real or imagined reason, or you have done something that would prove troublesome should you ever return. For whatever reason, those who you meet know that you are no longer welcome home even if they do not know the full details. You know that you are on your own as others are intimidated by you and prefer to keep you at arm’s reach, placating you only for as long as they must tolerate your presence.</p><hr /><p><strong>Skill Proficiencies: </strong>Intimidation, Survival</p><p><strong>Feature: </strong>@UUID[Compendium.world.adventures-in-middle-earth-backgrounds.Item.DAPdeWyaZnoNDhAl]{Infamous}</p><hr /><h3>Infamous</h3><p>Those who know of your past speak in half-hushed whispers of what drove you from your home. For some this is reason enough to give you a wide berth, for others it hints at a person desperate enough to take any job, no matter how menial or lowly. You can always find some sort of upkeep, at least enough to match your Standard of Living, whenever you are in a settlement of some sort.</p><hr /><h3>Suggested Characteristics</h3><p>Those Driven from Home are often seen as lone wolves who trust no one and who can’t be trusted themselves. This is not necessarily the case as many of those Driven from Home find camaraderie amongst fellow travellers, whether their travels are imposed or voluntary. When trust is earned, the Driven from Home are often among the most loyal and dedicated members of a company.</p><ul><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.ZYJFUJa92WyUMGXn]{Distinctive Quality}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.KKuS4P7iFYhOPsSk]{Specialty}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.AyYXuToWAhB1wWeR]{Hope}</p></li><li><p>@UUID[RollTable.kQjtPh5Y1vHFMS0C]{Despair}</p></li></ul>",
