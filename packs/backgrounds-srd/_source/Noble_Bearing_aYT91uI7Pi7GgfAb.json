You may call upon the rights of hospitality in any noble home and your words and advice often carry great weight; you aren’t easily dismissed. You are also expected to live up to your expectations and obligations, whatever they may be, and several nobles curry favour from you in the hopes that you reward them when your power is restored.</p>",
